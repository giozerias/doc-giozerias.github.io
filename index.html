    <h1>ATL Hiking</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/main_index_img.jpg" />
    <p>Not only do I look forward to the weekends because it's considered our "time off" but I rather enjoy being out doors and exploring the mountains, creeks, trails and parks Georgia has to offer. I also enjoy the look on my dog's (Luna and Willy) faces when I put on their gear and mount them on my truck. To be honest, it has been over a month that I haven't gone hiking. I blame it on my potato couch spirit. Anyways I can make a list for you guys of the parks/trials I have had the chance to visit:</p>
    <ul>
      <img src="assets/images/hiking_clip_art.jpg" />
      <li>Sweetwater Creek Trails</li>
      <li>MorningSide Nature Preserve</li>
      <li>Cochran Shoals to Sope Creek</li>
      <li>West Palisades Trail</li>
      <li>Lullwater Preserve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So don't let the patato couch spirit get to you and enjoy what nature has to offer! </h2>
