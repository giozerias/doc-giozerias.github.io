     <h4 id="main-text">Hello, Glad you stopped by! </h4>
     <p>I was born in a small state in Mexico, raised in Georgia. I am the oldest out of four sisters (for now) , yes, all sisters!
       Studied elementary in Georgia. For Middle and High school I was going back and fourth between Georgia and Morelos, Mx. At the time it was
       hard but I aprecaite going back and fourth because I got to learn Spanish and about my amazing culture.

       Foward a couple of years... I have a great husband that supports all of my goals. Two dogs that I love to go
       hiking with and a great family.
